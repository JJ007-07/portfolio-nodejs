# How can I visualise it?
### First you must have NodeJS installed on your machine. 
### Then from a CMD or terminal, or from your code editor with terminal included write:
## npm i
## npm start
## Finally open it in your preferred browser via localhost and the port used (3000), and you will see it correctly.
